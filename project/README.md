# Title
Reaction of the Swiss Twitter community to major events.

# Abstract
Social networks now have a huge importance in our lives and many people use them to comment about events that are happening around the globe. However, it seems that Twitter, one of the biggest player, isn't as used as Facebook or Instagram by Swiss people - There are about 10 times more Facebook accounts than Twitter accounts in Switzerland. With this project, we would like to see how the Swiss Twitter community reacts to important events happening in Switzerland or around the world. Our main goal is to determine to what extent and how well we can learn about what is happening in the world or in our country based on the Swiss tweets. The story we want to tell is the evolution of tweets during important events between 2010 and 2016 and discover what kind of events Swiss people are tweeting about the most. We are motivated to do this project and tell this story because none of us are active on Twitter and we're interested in understanding better how twitter is used in Switzerland.

# Research questions
- Can we detect events with the information contained in the tweets.
- What is the geographic repartition of the most popular events. (for local events and international events)
- What trend with respect to time can be seen for the most popular events.

# Dataset
For this project, we will use the Swiss tweets dataset. We could try to see if there are periods when the activity on twitter is higher than usually and if so, link them to actual events. We could also do this by looking at the most recurrent hashtags in a certain period of time (for instance #Rio2016, #JeSuisCharlie, #fukushima, ...). Additionally, we could use geolocation to detect more local events.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Scrape all the data from the web and get the frequency of tweets per day/month/year.
- Find some important events for which the twitter activity reaches a peak.
- For some period of time (in a month, or in a day with high tweet frequency), get the most used hashtags, to maybe discover an event.
- For some known events, quantify how much they were twitted about.
- ...
