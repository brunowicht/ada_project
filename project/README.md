# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.
For this we will use the Swiss tweets dataset. We could use the date at which tweets have been posted and see if there are periods when the activity on twitter is higher than usually. We could also study the hashtags which are the most recurrent and bind them to an event (for instace #Rio2016, #JeSuisCharlie, #fukushima, ...). We could also make use of the geolocation for more local events.
